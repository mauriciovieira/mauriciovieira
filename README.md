#### Short story 

I don't remember exactly the first time I programmed a computer, but it was in the 80's. Probably around 1987~1989. My father bought us a [MSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) computer with 2 catridge slots and [cassete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape) connection as well. I remember that I had no idea of how to save anything to the tapes, and there was a game of 200 or 300 lines in BASIC that my older brother and I had to type whenever we wanted to play. By then I rembember getting BASIC classes at school. (... to be continued)
